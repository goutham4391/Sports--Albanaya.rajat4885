<p>Demonstrating true maturity and sportsmanship, Lukeâ€™s playing partner got up and down from a hazard holing a 12-foot putt to win. Luke has developed into both an amazing player and a mature and incredible human being. </p>

Walker shot rounds of 81 and 71 on a very challenging golf course at Wild Dunes Resort Links in South Carolina.</p>

<p>This par-70 course is known for being very tough with hazards on every hole and very narrow fairways. This weekend provided an extra tough test in harsh conditions with about 15-25 mph winds all day. </p>

<p>After a challenging first round, Walker reminded himself to stay patient, remain disciplined and play the easiest shot possible. This resulted in his lowest score to date and a standout performance with the lowest score of the day in his division.</p>

After a tough week both mentally and physically, Emily traveled to Doral to compete in the Junior Orange Bowl and had to withdraw during the first round due to a shoulder injury.</p>

<p>Emily immediately went to physical therapy and tried her best to recover ahead of the PGA National Holiday Open. Despite not being able to practice or hit balls ahead of the tournament, Emily earned a 2nd place finish.</p>

<p>After the first round, Emily was four shots off the lead and played great golf in the second round to close the lead to just one stroke. Emily has shown tremendous heart to compete while nursing an injury. This is a true testament to Emily's commitment and dedication, and we congratulate her on an incredible performance.</p>
